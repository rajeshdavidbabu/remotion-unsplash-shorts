Instead, he emptied himself, taking on the form of a servant, being born in the likeness of men. And being found in human form, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross. It was for our sake that he bore the weight of our sin. He who knew no sin became sin, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God. By his wounds, we are healed, and through his sacrifice, we are reconciled to the father. This is the love of Christ, that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us. Therefore, let us live no longer for ourselves, but for him who for our sake died and was raised.",

And being found in human form, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross. It was for our sake that he bore the weight of our sin.\n\nHe who knew no sin became sin, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God. By his wounds, we are healed, and through his sacrifice, we are reconciled to the father. This is the love of Christ, that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.
